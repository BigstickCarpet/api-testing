What is this?
--------------------------
This website accompanies a talk/workshop ([here's the slide deck](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/super-powered-api-testing/blob/master/presentation.pdf)) that discusses and compares various API testing tools and best-practices.  I've re-created the same API test suite in several different tools to make it easy to compare and contrast them in terms of features, ease-of-use, syntax, etc.


Getting Started
--------------------------
- **Step 1: Download the tests**<br>
[This zip file](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/super-powered-api-testing/archive/master.zip) contains all the sample tests and code you'll need.

- **Step 2: Setup each tool**<br>
Some of the testing tools require you to download and install them. Others require you to create free online accounts.  Here are the setup instructions for each tool:

    - [Mocha+Chai](./mocha-chai/)
    - [Restlet](./restlet/)
    - [Postman](./postman/)
    - [Stoplight](./stoplight/)


The _✨Super Tech Heroes✨_ API
--------------------------
This is the REST API that we're testing.  It's a directory of technology-themed superheroes, sidekicks, and villains.
