[![Super-Powered API Testing](Images/Title-Banner.png)](http://apitesting.bigstickcarpet.com)

What is this?
--------------------------
This project demonstrates and compares various API testing tools, namely [Mocha+Chai](./Mocha-Chai/), [Restlet](./Restlet/), [Postman](./Postman/), and [Stoplight](./Stoplight/). I have re-created the same test suite in each tool to make it easy to compare and contrast them in terms of features, ease-of-use, syntax, etc.


Getting Started
--------------------------
- **Step 1: Download the tests**<br>
[This zip file](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/super-powered-api-testing/archive/master.zip) contains all the sample tests and code you'll need.

- **Step 2: Setup each tool**<br>
Some of the testing tools require you to download and install them. Others require you to create free online accounts.  The setup instructions for each tool are in the `README.md` file in each folder.

    - [Mocha+Chai](./Mocha-Chai/)
    - [Restlet](./Restlet/)
    - [Postman](./Postman/)
    - [Stoplight](./Stoplight/)


The Sample API
--------------------------
I've created a simple REST API that's used for all of the tests in this project.  It's just a list of superheroes, sidekicks, and villains, which you can perform CRUD operations on.
