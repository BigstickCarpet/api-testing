What is this?
--------------------------
This website accompanies a talk/workshop ([here's the slide deck](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/super-powered-api-testing/blob/master/presentation.pdf)) that discusses and compares various API testing tools and best-practices.  I've re-created the same API test suite in several different tools to make it easy to compare and contrast them in terms of features, ease-of-use, syntax, etc.


Getting Started
--------------------------
You'll need to download and install each of the testing tools to follow-along with the demos.  Some tools require a bit of setup, such as installing dependencies or creating free online accounts.  Here are the setup instructions for each tool:

- [Mocha+Chai](mocha-chai/)
- [Restlet](restlet/)
- [Postman](postman/)
- [Stoplight](stoplight/)


The Demo API
--------------------------
This is the REST API that we're testing.  It's a directory of technology-themed superheroes, sidekicks, and villains.
